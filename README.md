# V-Cast Brush Wiper
Models for a brass brush holder for wiping the nozzle on a RatRig V-Cast printer.

Made to work with brass brushes with the handle cut off. Current implementation was designed for use with a Titan Aero on a slightly modified EVA mount, so it may need modifications to fit other setups. STEP file is included for ease of modification.

Model provided for left extruder. For use on the right extruder, make sure to mirror the model!

Should print easily without support.

Happy printing!
